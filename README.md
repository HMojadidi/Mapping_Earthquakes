# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this project was to use earthquake GeoJSON data collected from the USGS API, to create interactive maps of earthquakes around the world reflecting the past 7 days.
The earthquake data is represented on the maps in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and according to each event's magnitude.
